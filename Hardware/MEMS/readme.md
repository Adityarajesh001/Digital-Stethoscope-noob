Sensitivity, the ratio of the output value to the input pressure, is a key specification of any microphone. Microphone sensitivity is typically measured with a 1 kHz sine wave at a 94 dB sound pressure level (SPL), or 1 pascal (Pa) pressure. 
Digital MEMS sensors produce a digital output signal that is quantized into discrete values. Digital MEMS sensors convert the analog signal from the sensor into a digital signal, which is then processed by a microcontroller or other digital processing unit. Digital MEMS sensors can offer many advantages over analog sensors, such as improved noise immunity, lower power consumption, and greater flexibility in signal processing.
The dBFS measurement scale represents the ratio of the digital output level of the microphone to the maximum possible digital output level of the device, expressed in decibels. Therefore, a sensitivity rating of -26 dBFS means that the microphone produces a digital output level that is 26 dB lower than the maximum possible digital output level of the device when subjected to a 1 Pa input signal.
Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a measure of the difference between the level of a desired audio signal and the level of background noise in an audio system or recording. In general, a higher SNR indicates that the audio signal is stronger relative to the background noise, which can lead to a clearer and more accurate representation of the desired sound source. A lower SNR, on the other hand, can result in a higher level of background noise and a lower-quality audio signal.
